# Unity Editor State

**Important Announcement: Major API Changes**

With the beta release for version 1.0.0, we've introduced significant changes to the API surface. These modifications are extensive and render nearly the entire prior documentation obsolete.

At this beta stage, I've opted not to provide documentation. As we move closer to the stable release, a comprehensive set of documentation will be available in the project's wiki.

**Caution: Transition Challenges Ahead**

If you decide to explore this beta release for any reason, please be aware that transitioning from a 0.X workflow to b1.X may present considerable challenges. Take this into consideration before diving into the beta version.

The major release will not provide a migration guide, it will not be worth it.

### **Installation**

* Open your unity package manager (`Window > Package Manager`)
* Click `+ > Add package from git url`
* Enter `https://github.com/AbandonedCrypt/editor-state.git#beta`
* You're Done
